Code to extract the tweets from Twitter API

Instructions for the Python Code to using in Social media.

Hi all, here I am Introducing a new area of python programming  will be use to collects some raw data of particular topic . That is trending topics currently from various social medias. 
say, Twitter, Facebook, etc. 

Here I considered Twitter Social media. Since Twitter is a basic hot platform for many users can express their opinions or emotions within fraction of seconds around the world. These topics related to any model, Actors, or Any Government, Organisations, And any personals. So all are included in one platform Twitter And Commmunicate with many around GLobe.

Basically, Twitter is made up the purpose of connect to people around world with their feelings sharing as textual form. So many tweets are generated as Texts withins seconds. Then Complex and very tadious work to catch those tweets manually is not possible at that time. Hence its the small code snippet to overcome the Problem to minimize the Complex work to Easily.

Please Read forward to about this.

Twitter is a Social media. and Python is a Interpreter Language used to efficiently in such a way that extract the tweets directly from Twitter API about any particular topic or keyword given. and processing these tweets using some Algorithms already defined in the code. such as removing unwanted chars, Symbols, Whitespaces, Colons, Hashtags, many more. 
After removed can give the Classification methods / algorithm can gives only the Textual form and apply the classifiers as defined earlier in sample input texts with them and after this step to classify them as Negative, Positive and Neutral based on the tweets polarity by checking classifiers.

At the FInal,
After the classifiers, ensures that the No. of tweets as gives as POS,NEG,Neutral with some percentage noted.

Hence, we can get to know about on which topic how much peoples are talking about at the Particular time.

I hope This could be helpful for you,,,

Thank u.
